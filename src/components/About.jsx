        Since 2020, I've been actively pursuing my interest in game development. I've been studying 
        programming languages and game design principles, and I've been practicing my skills by 
        creating my own games and collaborating with others on game development projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        What drives my passion for game development is the desire to innovate and create something 
        new and exciting in the gaming industry. I'm always brainstorming new game ideas and 
        exploring ways to push the boundaries of what is possible in gaming.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, my love for game development since 2020 is a constant source of inspiration and 
        motivation for me. It drives me to learn and improve my skills, and it fuels my dream of creating 
        games that people will love and enjoy for years to come
